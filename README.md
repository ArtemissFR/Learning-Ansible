# ~ Learning Ansible ~

This Ansible project is a collection of various tests and roles that I have experimented with. It aims to provide practical examples of using Ansible to automate different tasks in diverse environments.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```

| |-- test2/
| |-- ...
|-- roles/

|-- inventories/
|-- playbooks/
|-- README.md
```

- **roles/** : Ansible roles used in the tests, each role in its own directory.
