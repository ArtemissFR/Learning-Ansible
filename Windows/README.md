# üåê Allow Ping and Activate SSH on Windows

This guide outlines the steps to allow ICMP ping and activate the SSH server (OpenSSH) on a Windows system using PowerShell.

## Allow Ping (ICMP)

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**
   Right-click on the Start menu (or press Win+X) and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)".

2. **Allow incoming ICMPv4 ping:**
   ```powershell
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow incoming ICMPv4 ping" -Protocol ICMPv4 -IcmpType 8 -Enabled True -Action Allow
   ```

3. **Allow incoming ICMPv6 ping (optional):**
   ```powershell
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow incoming ICMPv6 ping" -Protocol ICMPv6 -IcmpType 128 -Enabled True -Action Allow
   ```

## Activate SSH (OpenSSH) üîí

1. **Install the OpenSSH server via PowerShell:**
   ```powershell
   Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server
   ```

2. **Start the SSH service (sshd):**
   ```powershell
   Start-Service sshd
   ```

3. **Set SSH service (sshd) to start automatically:**
   ```powershell
   Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'
   ```

4. **Configure the firewall to allow SSH traffic (port 22):**
   ```powershell
   New-NetFirewallRule -Name sshd -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22
   ```

## Enable WinRM (Windows Remote Management) üöÄ

1. **Enable WinRM and configure firewall rules:**
   Run the following commands in PowerShell as Administrator to enable WinRM and configure firewall rules for WinRM:

   ```powershell
   # Enable WinRM (Windows Remote Management)
   Enable-PSRemoting -Force

   # Configure firewall rule for WinRM HTTP (port 5985)
   New-NetFirewallRule -Name "WinRM-HTTP-In-TCP" -DisplayName "Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)" -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5985
   ```

   If you use WinRM with encryption (HTTPS), also configure a firewall rule for WinRM HTTPS (port 5986):

   ```powershell
   # Configure firewall rule for WinRM HTTPS (port 5986)
   New-NetFirewallRule -Name "WinRM-HTTPS-In-TCP" -DisplayName "Windows Remote Management (HTTPS-In)" -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5986
   ```

2. **Verify WinRM status:**
   After running the commands, verify the current status of WinRM using the following PowerShell commands:

   ```powershell
   # Check WinRM service status
   Get-Service WinRM

   # Check WinRM configuration
   Get-WSManInstance WinRM/Config/WinRS -ComputerName localhost
   ```
   
## Notes ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- Ensure all PowerShell commands are run as Administrator.
- After configuring the SSH server, you will be able to connect to your Windows machine using a third-party SSH client (e.g., PuTTY).
- Make sure to configure appropriate access permissions to ensure the security of your SSH server.
